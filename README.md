# Machine-learing-with-python-
 load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:  k-Nearest Neighbour Decision Tree Support Vector Machine Logistic Regression The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:  Jaccard index, F1-score,  LogLoass

1. Building model using KNN, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation 
2. Building model using Decision Tree, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation 
3. Building model using SVM, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation 
4. Building model using Logistic Regression, finding the best k and accuracy evaluation
